# Context Practice

Welcome to my exploration of JavaScript context in the Context Practice section of the App Academy Open project! This project is part of my learning journey at App Academy Open, where I've been honing my skills in full-stack development.

## Setup

1. Clone the starter repository from the [Starter Link](starter-link).
2. Run `npm install` to install any dependencies.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Car - Revving Up My Understanding

In this phase, I'm creating a `Car` class to explore how to set and retrieve the speed of a car.

### Phase 2: Calculator - Crunching Numbers

I'm delving into arithmetic operations with the `Calculator` class, mastering basic math and maintaining a running total.

### Phase 3: Dog - Unleashing the Pawsome

With the `Dog` class, I'm naming, changing names, and making dogs speak. It's time to give these furry friends a voice!

### Phase 4: changeContext - Shifting Perspectives

Using the `changeContext` function, I'm learning how to alter the context of a function, gaining a deeper understanding of JavaScript's inner workings.

### Phase 5: bindToAnArg - Binding Wisdom

With `bindToAnArg`, I'm harnessing the power to bind arguments to functions, creating new functions with preset parameters.

### Phase 6: FancyCalculator - Elevating My Calculation Game

Extending the `Calculator` class, I'm tackling advanced operations like setting totals, calculating modulo, and squaring numbers.

### Phase 7: allTheArgs - Embracing Function Flexibility

By manipulating functions with `allTheArgs`, I'm ensuring they're always invoked with specific arguments, enhancing flexibility and efficiency.

### Phase 8: CallCenter - Dialing into Delayed Greetings

In the `CallCenter` class, I'm scheduling delayed calls to greet clients, adding a personal touch to customer interactions.

### Phase 9: callOnTarget - Targeted Invocation Mastery

Mastering the art of targeted function invocation, I'm using `callOnTarget` to execute functions with precise contexts and arguments.

### Phase 10: PartyPlanner - Planning Memorable Gatherings

With the `PartyPlanner` class, I'm orchestrating unforgettable events by managing guest lists and throwing epic parties.

### Phase 11: boundFuncTimer - Timing Function Calls

Using `boundFuncTimer`, I'm honing my skills in invoking functions with specific delays and contexts, adding precision to my code.

## Testing My Skills

Each phase comes with its own set of test specs located in the `test` directory. I put my skills to the test by running the specs with the command `npm test <test-file>`.
