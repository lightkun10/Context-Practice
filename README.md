# Context Practice

Welcome to the Context Practice section of the App Academy Open project, where you'll hone your skills in understanding and manipulating context in JavaScript.

## Set Up

To get started with this practice:

1. Clone the starter repository from the [Starter Link](starter-link).
2. Run `npm install` to install any dependencies.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Car

In this phase, you'll create a `Car` class that allows you to set and retrieve the speed of the car.

### Phase 2: Calculator

The `Calculator` class will enable you to perform basic arithmetic operations and maintain a running total.

### Phase 3: Dog

You'll work with the `Dog` class to create instances of dogs, change their names, and make them speak.

### Phase 4: changeContext

Learn how to change the context of a function using the `changeContext` function.

### Phase 5: bindToAnArg

With the `bindToAnArg` function, you'll bind arguments to a function to create a new function with preset parameters.

### Phase 6: FancyCalculator

Extend the `Calculator` class to include more advanced operations such as setting the total, calculating the modulo, and squaring.

### Phase 7: allTheArgs

Using the `allTheArgs` function, you'll manipulate a function to always be invoked with specific arguments.

### Phase 8: CallCenter

The `CallCenter` class allows you to schedule delayed calls to greet clients.

### Phase 9: callOnTarget

With `callOnTarget`, you'll invoke a function with one object as its context and another object as its argument.

### Phase 10: PartyPlanner

Create a `PartyPlanner` class to manage guest lists and throw amazing parties.

### Phase 11: boundFuncTimer

The `boundFuncTimer` function invokes a function with a specified delay and context.

## Testing

Each phase includes test specs located in the `test` directory. Run the test specs with the command `npm test <test-file>`.
